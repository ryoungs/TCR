      "The Cats in the CityLocation: an Arab city.Time: the age of defeat. The twenty-first century.General atmosphere: "fancy- neighborhoods.Expensive houses painted in tombstone colors.Beautiful and well-maintained gardens.Flowers that no one dares to smell.Imported cars.Imported devices.Imported clothes.Imported foods.Endless consumer shops for anything and everything.Between every other restaurant,there are shops selling cosmetics and souvenirs.Between every other consumer market,There is a worship place.All consumer shops are built skillfullyOn the scab of the same old wound;A wound that can flood the city with blood and deathWith the slightest fingernail scratch.As I walk farther from the city,The consumer shops vanish.The lights are suddenly dimmed.The cheering and the hustle and bustle of the consumers go silent.I see myself in total darkness.I am alone hearing nothing but the sounds of my footsteps,And the meows of hungry stray street cats,Covered with the ashes of daily existence.A thin and hungry cat approaches me,She meows in despair and starvation,Begging me for her bite of the day (or the week-)I throw her a small piece of my sandwich.She picks it up and runs awayTo celebrate her temporary gains!She leaves me alone wondering in darkness:What reflects the reality of this city moreThe 'fancy' neighborhoods I saw earlier,Or the starving cats in the darkness-June 8, 2014-

    <p style="padding: 10px 50px 10px">  The objective of "The Cat Room" is to present Cats at Animal Care & Control in a slightly different way. We hope to give potental adoptors and those looking for lost animals quick access to pictures and data. </a></p>

    <p style="padding: 10px 50px 10px">  For more photos and information about fosters, <a href="foster.html">click here and go to bottom of the Foster page</a>!</p>

    <p style="padding: 10px 50px 10px">   The Cat Room follows the terms and conditions of Anne Arundel County Animal Care & Control (AACACC).  All the photos and data come from the primary AACACC webpages.  With just one click, The Cat Room is accessible and quick to reach; it is especially helpful for those looking for a lost cat as it combines information (age, length of stay, sex, etc.) with a photo. In the future look for links to "The Cat Room" in social media.  Expect changes and an occasional oops.  We hope it is useful and results in more adoptions and redemptions.<p>

    <p style="padding: 10px 50px 20px"> The Cat Room will also be a place with feline behavior references as well as historical day to day statistics for the cats in the shelter's care.
